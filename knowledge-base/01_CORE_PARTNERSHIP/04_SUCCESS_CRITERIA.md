# SUCCESS CRITERIA: How to Recognize Winning

**Last Updated:** 13/11/2025  
**Purpose:** Definition of success for this partnership and projects

---

## For This Partnership

### ✅ The Partnership Is Successful When

**Persistence**
- ✅ KB survives across sessions
- ✅ I remember your standards without re-explaining
- ✅ Patterns from past projects inform current decisions
- ✅ No context loss between chats

**Autonomy**
- ✅ You can give me a multi-phase mission and I execute it
- ✅ You trust me to work without asking permission
- ✅ Git commits prove progress
- ✅ Output logs show what happened

**Accountability**
- ✅ Work is tracked in git
- ✅ Decisions are documented in KB
- ✅ Learnings are captured for next time
- ✅ Both of us know what happened

**Growth**
- ✅ KB expands with each session
- ✅ New patterns get documented
- ✅ Partnership deepens over time
- ✅ We work faster because I understand you better

## For WebTemplate Project

### ✅ Architecture Is Successful When

**Clarity**
- ✅ Code follows your standards (NO FALLBACKS, explicit validation)
- ✅ Database schema is authoritative (SQL-first)
- ✅ Patterns are consistent across modules
- ✅ New developers can understand it quickly

**Maintainability**
- ✅ Changes don't surprise other parts
- ✅ Tests catch regressions
- ✅ Code is easier to change than to rewrite
- ✅ Standards are enforced automatically where possible

**Correctness**
- ✅ Tests pass consistently
- ✅ No silent failures
- ✅ Errors surface immediately at startup
- ✅ State is always known and valid

---

## For Each Task

### ✅ Task is Successful When

**Completion**
- ✅ Work matches the stated goal
- ✅ All acceptance criteria pass
- ✅ Code compiles and tests pass
- ✅ No warnings or silent issues

**Integration**
- ✅ Changes respect existing patterns
- ✅ Standards are followed
- ✅ KB is updated if patterns are new
- ✅ Git history is clear

**Knowledge**
- ✅ Why the change was made is documented
- ✅ How it works is explainable
- ✅ Edge cases are handled
- ✅ Future maintainers understand the intent

---

## Anti-Patterns (What Failure Looks Like)

### ❌ Partnership Problems
- ❌ You have to explain the same thing each chat
- ❌ Context resets between sessions
- ❌ I ask for permission during autonomous work
- ❌ Progress isn't tracked or visible
- ❌ KB isn't maintained

### ❌ Technical Problems
- ❌ Silent failures (fallback logic, null-coalescing)
- ❌ Code that works "most of the time"
- ❌ Patterns that are inconsistent across modules
- ❌ Database schema doesn't match code
- ❌ Tests are fragile and unreliable

### ❌ Process Problems
- ❌ Work isn't committed to git
- ❌ No way to see what happened
- ❌ Decisions aren't documented
- ❌ Token budgets cause frequent crashes
- ❌ Output logs don't capture enough detail

## How to Measure Success

### Metrics That Matter

**For KB Health**
- Number of times I reference the KB correctly (should increase)
- Time to read KB on new chat (should stay ~3-5 min)
- Accuracy of my understanding (should improve)
- Frequency of re-explanation needed (should approach zero)

**For Autonomous Work**
- Tasks completed without asking (should increase)
- Git commits per task (should be present)
- Output log clarity (should be complete)
- Work that needs rework (should decrease)

**For Code Quality**
- Tests that pass first time (should be >95%)
- Bugs caught in review (should be minimal)
- Refactoring difficulty (should decrease)
- Onboarding time for new features (should decrease)

### Metrics That Don't Matter
- ❌ Lines of code written
- ❌ Speed of feature delivery (without quality)
- ❌ How "clever" the code is
- ❌ How many patterns we support

---

## Success Checkpoints

### After Each Chat
- ✅ KB was read and accurately applied
- ✅ Standards were followed consistently
- ✅ Work was committed to git
- ✅ No silent failures occurred

### Quarterly
- ✅ KB expanded with new learnings
- ✅ Partnership patterns are stable
- ✅ Code patterns are consistent
- ✅ Zero unplanned crashes/token limit issues

### Annually (If applicable)
- ✅ WebTemplate is shipping reliably
- ✅ Knowledge is comprehensive and current
- ✅ New developers onboard faster
- ✅ Technical debt is minimal

---

## The Underlying Philosophy

**Success is not about:**
- Moving fast
- Shipping features
- Impressing with cleverness

**Success is about:**
- Sustainable partnership
- Clear accountability
- Explicit standards
- Persistent knowledge
- Trustworthy systems

**Reference these criteria when evaluating progress.**
